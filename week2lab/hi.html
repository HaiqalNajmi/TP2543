      		Hi, my name is Muhammad Haiqal Najmi. I am a second year Software Engineering student from National University of Malaysia, UKM. This is my page for my web programming course. I have something to say about myself. Let me give a try to see what kind of image you have about me through my self-description. I hope that my impression about myself and your impression about me are not so different. Here it goes. 
      	</p>
      	<p>
      		For me, technology is such a wonderful thing to begin with because it constantly evolves from a simple calculation tools to an advanced quantum computer. I am a person who have a huge passion in exploring new things, be it in sports, act of self-development, technology or even programming and web development. Last but not least, I am a committed and self-motivated son to parents and families who always want to help educate and financially support their family.
